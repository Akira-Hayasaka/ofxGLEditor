Description
-----------

Sample Lua syntax highlighting:  
![image](https://github.com/Akira-Hayasaka/ofxGLEditor/raw/master/doc/syntax_highlighting.png)

ofxEditor provides a rewrite of the [Fluxus live coding environment](http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus)'s OpenGL-based text editor for OpenFrameworks including simple syntax highlighting, a file browser, and a Read-Eval-Print Loop console. The ofxGLEditor provides all of the above including 9 editor buffers, so it should be easy to use this as a basis for live coding, scripting, parameter tweaking, etc. Further, ofxEditorSyntax & ofxEditorColorScheme provide simple language specific syntax highlighting.

[See a video of the livecodingExample which demonstrates the basic ofxEditor class with syntax highlighting using ofxLua.](https://vimeo.com/116370247)

Variable width font and full unicode glyph support (here using Arial Unicode.tff):

Build Requirements
------------------

To use ofxGLEditor, first you need to download and install OpenFrameworks. Development is against the latest version of OpenFrameworks on github. Checkout a tag if you need an earlier, stable version.

[OF github repository](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks)

On Mac OSX, you will need to install Xcode.

On Linux, you can use Makefiles and/or Codeblocks project files (without the "_win" suffix).

On Win, you will need either Microsoft Visual Studio C++ or [Codeblocks+MiniGW](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26) and the [Win Codeblocks OF package](http://www.openframeworks.cc/download). Use the Codeblocks projects files with the "_win" suffix.

Installation
------------

Place ofxGLEditor within a folder in the addons folder of the OF dir tree:
<pre>
openframeworks/addons/ofxGLEditor
</pre>

Usage
-----

See the examples in `editorSyntaxExample`, `glEditorExample`, `glslExample`, `livecodingExample`, and the source headers in `ofxGLEditor/src`.

### Examples

Project files for the examples are not included so you will need to generate the project files for your operating system and development environment using the OF ProjectGenerator which is included with the OpenFrameworks distribution.

Point the ProjectGenerator to `addons/ofxGLEditor`, change the project name to the **exact** name of the example you want to generate (ie `editorExample`), and make sure to choose `ofxGLEditor` from the addons. Hitting "Generate Project" will populate that example with the project files you will need to build it.

#### glslExample

This is a simple GLSL fragment (pixel) shader editor including GLSL syntax highlighting. The shader is reloaded whenever it is saved or evaluated (MD key + e).

#### liveCodingExample

This is a simple livecoding example using ofxLua including lua keyword syntax highlighting. Also, you will need to select `ofxLua` from the addons list when you generate the project files for this example.

### Syntaxes

A growing set of language syntax xml files can be found in the `syntaxes` folder. Additions or updates are welcome. 

### Font

Both monospaced and variable width fonts are supported. PrintChar21.ttf is included with the example projects. Unicode glyphs are supported if your font has them.

Most *real* text editors load multiple fonts to support different language character sets. ofxGLEditor is *simple*, so it only loads 1 font at a time and you'll need to use an expanded character set font for multiple languages. Another option is to load a specifc font for a specific language or locale in your app. Giant full character set fonts do exist (eg. [Unifont](http://www.unifoundry.com/unifont.html]), but they are generally too large to be useful as they may take a lagre amount of resources. Your mileage may vary.
